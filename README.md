# GWTIT

The GWTIT. The Geography, Weather, Time Information Tool.

Basically, I wanted to actually use Flask for something since this website didnt really use it. And I also wanted to test myself on something I dont have much experience with (APIs). So I decided to make this simple tool. Basically, you select your country from the dropdown menu, and it prints out the capital, population, language, weather and time of said country.

It's a very simple program. It's not meant to be published or anything, just as a way for me to test myself using some things I never used before and learn something new.

I feel like the code for this was way cleaner and neater than this website. But it's still not the best. Next I think I want to test myself with Java. My OOP quiz is coming soon so I should probably get to work on that.
